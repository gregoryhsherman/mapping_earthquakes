This demostrates how Leaflet.js is used to visualize geoJSON data. The javascript uses Leaflet layer control using basemaps and overlay maps using a live API feed provided by the USGS(United States Geological Survey). The data includes all earthquake data for the Past 30 Days. Additional layer of tectonic plates provides the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activites.
